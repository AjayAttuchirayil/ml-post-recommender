# ðŸ§  Personalized Post Recommender

A mini machine learning project inspired by Metaâ€™s recommendation systems. The goal is to simulate a content feed that recommends posts to users based on their interests and past behavior.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem

Given a set of users, posts, and user-post interactions (likes/views), train a model that predicts how likely a user is to like a new post.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

Simulated data using:
- 100 users
- 1,000 posts (across 7 topics)
- Synthetic interactions (like, view) based on user-topic match

---

## ðŸ”§ ML Pipeline

| Step                | Details |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Data simulation** | Generate user interests and synthetic post text |
| **Feature engineering** | TF-IDF embeddings of post text, topic match, interaction one-hot |
| **Model** | LightGBM classifier |
| **Evaluation** | ROC-AUC, can extend to NDCG@k / MAP@k for ranking |
| **App** | Streamlit demo to simulate recommendations |

---

## ðŸ§  Features Used

- TF-IDF features from post text (top 100 tokens)
- Binary flag if post topic matches user interests
- One-hot encoding for interaction type
